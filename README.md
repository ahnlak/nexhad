Nexus Of Hades
==============

Nexus of Hades (aka nexhad) is a classic style Roguelike. Initially started as
a way to get back into the language I love - C - the aim is to build a large,
sophisticated, cross-platform RL.

Originally started in PDCurses, I have since realised that re-inventing the 
wheel at the same time as developing game concepts is... excessive.

I have since switched to using the excellent libtcod, and working in Visual
Studio. Neither of these should render nexhad unportable, but if you want to
compile outside of the Windows ecosystem you are, for now, on your own.

As before, my current aspiration is to switch to a pure libSDL approach in the
fullness of time...

Features
--------

* classical character-based display, but in a much larger window than 80x25!
* mouse aware
* limited pool of playable races & classes
* all classes playable by all races (but there will obviously be natural fits)
* pantheon of Good, Evil and Neutral Gods to please (or displease!)
* factions
* deep quest system
* loads of other stuff to come...

PLEASE NOTE
===========

As of right now, this project is in it's very early stages and I'm only putting
it onto Github as an easy way to shift code around. While it should always be
in a buildable state, that doesn't mean it's in a playable state, or that it's
anything close to being a playable game.

Although the aim is to make this a cross-platform game, all development is
taking place under Visual Studio on Windows. It's highly unlikely that it will 
compile happily under Linux right now, although hopefully that will be an easy 
step once I reach that stage of the project.
